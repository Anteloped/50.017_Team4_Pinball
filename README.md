# Sky Pinball

User Interface:
Press and hold the space bar to launch the ball. The time for pressing the space bar will determine the force to launch the ball. The higher the force, the faster the ball will be launched.
Press “A” to lift up the left slider and press “D” to lift up the right slider. Sliders will exert a force on the ball to prevent the ball from falling down.
Press “Z” to tilt the table to the right and press “X” to tilt the table to the left. The ball will move sideward due to gravity.
When the game ends, press “Restart” to start a new game.

Everytime your reset the clouds auto re-generate!
